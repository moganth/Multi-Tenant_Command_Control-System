# Multi-Tenant Command & Control System

A scalable platform for remote monitoring and control of distributed devices and systems with tenant isolation and real-time communication capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Modern organizations require centralized control over distributed devices, systems, and processes across multiple departments, or clients. Traditional solutions often lack:

- **Tenant Isolation**: Secure separation of data and operations between different organizations or departments
- **Real-time Communication**: Instant bidirectional communication with remote devices```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
- **Reliability**: Robust command execution, failure handling, and system monitoring
- **Multi-protocol Support**: Integration with various device types and communication protocols
- **Centralized Management**: Unified dashboard for monitoring, control, and analytics

This creates operational inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and scalability bottlenecks that hinder business growth and digital transformation initiatives.

## Description

The Multi-Tenant Command & Control System is a comprehensive IoT and device management platform built on modern cloud-native technologies. It provides a unified interface for monitoring, controlling, and managing distributed devices while ensuring complete tenant isolation and data security.

The platform leverages microservices architecture with containerized deployment, enabling horizontal scaling and fault tolerance. It supports multiple communication protocols, real-time data streaming, and provides extensive APIs for integration with existing systems.

Key architectural components include FastAPI for high-performance APIs, MQTT/EMQ X for reliable device communication, Celery for background processing, MongoDB for flexible data storage, Supabase for authentication, and Firebase for real-time UI updates.
